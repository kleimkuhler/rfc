# Linkerd RFC Process

- Contribution Name: linkerd_rfc_process
- Start Date: 2019-01-23

- Linkerd Issue: NA

## Summary

[summary]: #summary

The Linkerd project needs a formal process to understand and communicate
upcoming changes to Linkerd, as well as shepherd contributions from the
community into the project.

The purpose of the RFC process is to reduce the amount of "tribal knowledge" in
our community. By moving decisions into a well tracked artifact, this process
aims to enhance communication and discoverability.

## Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

This work will make it clear to contributors how to get their contributions into
Linkerd and the status of that work at any point in the process. It also enables
the Linkerd maintainers to understand the progression of work coming into the
project, it's status and whether it's waiting on their involvement.

## Reference-level explanation

[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

We will be using [the RFC repository](https://github.com/linkerd/rfc) to store
active and archived RFC's and the review / acceptence process through pull
requests.

### Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Github is a more difficult medium for conversation than Google Doc, but it does
centralize the process.

### Prior art

[prior-art]: #prior-art

Previously this work was all managed via Github issues in projects boards, with
Google docs used to do planning and discussion.
