## Summary

[summary]: #summary

This RFC aims to move prometheus as an add-on i.e not mandated but advised. This
includes moving the linkerd-prometheus manifests as a sub-chart and allowing
more configuration (more on this later), along with documentation and tooling to
use Linkerd with an existing prometheus installation.

## Problem Statement (Step 1)

[problem-statement]: #problem-statement

Lots of users already have a exisiting prometheus installation in their cluster
and don't like managing another prometheus instance especially because they
could be resource intensive and painful. They usually have a prometheus
installation paired up with a long term monitroing solutions like
Cortex,InfluxDB, or third party solutions like Grafana Cloud, etc. In those
cases prometheus is just a temporary component, that keeps pushing metrics into
their long term solution, making users want to re-use their exisitng prometheus.

The following are the list of problems that we plan to solve:

- Hard requirement of linkerd-prometheus.

- Configuring the current linkerd-prometheus for remote-writes, etc is hard,
  because the prometheus configmap is overridden after upgrades.

- Not enough documentation and tooling for bringing your own prometheus
  use-case.

Once the RFC is implemented, Users should not only be able to use their
exisiting prometheus, but configuration of the linkerd-prometheus for
remote-writes, etc should also be easy.

## Design proposal (Step 2)

[design-proposal]: #design-proposal

### Prometheus as an Add-On

By moving Prometheus as an add-on, We can make it as an optional component that
can be used both through Helm and Linkerd CLI. The add-on model would well with
upgrades, etc as per [#3955](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/pull/3955).
This is done by moving the prometheus components into a separate sub-chart in
the linkerd repo and updating the code. The same health checks are also
expected, but as a separate check Category, which would be transient i.e runs
only when it recognises that the add-on is enabled.

By default, the prometheus add-on will be **enabled**.

This also provides a single place of configuration for all things related to
linkerd-prometheus. Though we are making linkerd-prometheus optional but having
it is great for Linkerd and external users, for reasons like separation of
concerns, etc. By allowing the `remote-write`, `alerts`, etc configuration in
the linkerd-prometheus, we would decrease the need/want for external users to
tie their existing prometheus to Linkerd, as it would be even easier for them to
configure `remote-write`, etc configuration from their exisiting prometheus to
the linkerd-prometheus right from the start.

The following default prometheus configuration is planned:

```yaml
prometheus:
  enabled: true
  name: linkerd-prometheus
  image:
  args:
  # - log.format: json
  global:
    <global-prom-config> https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#configuration-file
  remote-write:
    <remote-write-config> https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write
  alertManagers:
    <alert-manager-config> https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#alertmanager_config
  configMapMounts:
  # - name: alerting-rules
  #   subPath: alerting_rules.yml
  #   configMap: linkerd-prometheus-rules
```

All the current default configuration will be moved to `values.yaml` in the
above format, allowing users to override this by using Helm or  
`--addon-config` through CLI.

### Using Exisiting Prometheus

First, Documentation will be provided at `linkerd.io` to guide users on adding
the `scrape-configs` required, to get the metrics from linkerd proxies, control
plane components, etc. This can be found
[here](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/blob/master/charts/linkerd2/templates/prometheus.yaml#L26).
Additional documentation on the storage requirements for Linkerd metrics in
prometheus can also be provided around existing installations with longer
retention times, scrape interval changes, etc. This can also be automated like
we already do with Linkerd CLI help and args.

Once this is done, Users should be able to see golden metrics, etc in their
exisiting prometheus instance. The `.Values.global.prometheusUrl` field helps
users in configuring Linkerd components i.e `public-api`,etc that needs
prometheus access to the exisiting prometheus installation.

`prometheusUrl` is present in `.Values.global` instead of `.Values.prometheus.`
to allow this field to be accessible by other addOn components like `grafana`,
etc. `linkerd-config-addons` Configmap will also be updated to store the same.

Flag interactions are defined below:

| `prometheus.enabled` | `global.prometheusUrl`              | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| true    | ""               | Install linkerd-prometheus, and configure control-plane components to use it.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| false   | "prometheus.xyz" | No linkerd-prometheus, control-plane components will be configured to url                                                                                                                                                                        |
| true    | "prometheus.xyz" | Install linkerd-prometheus, but stil configure control plane to use different url, useful when linkerd-prometheus is configured to remote-write into long term storage solution at url, Thus  powering dashboard and CLI through long term storage. |
| false   | ""               | No linkerd-prometheus, and no URL to power dashboards. (Should we even allow this?)                                                                                                                                                              |

#### User Expereince

Currently, `public-api`, `grafana` and `heartbeat` are the only three components
which are configured with a `prometheus-url` parameter, All the Dashboards and
CLI are powered through the `public-api`. This allows us to swap prometheus
without breaking any exisiting linkerd tooling. Though it is expected that the
`scrape-config` is configured correctly, when this path is choosen.

If `prometheus-url` is not accessible, components like `public-api` should not
fail but just log some warning. So, that users can still access things like TAP,
Checks, etc through the dashboard and CLI.

#### Linkerd CLI Tooling

When users get their own Prometheus, It would be really great to have some
tooling that allows users to check and troubleshoot if there are any problems.

##### linkerd check

Checks can be added to report if the prometheus is configured correctly and is
replying to queries.

- Check if the configured prometheus instance is healthy.
- if the relevant metrics are present in prometheus by querying, and warn the
  users about the same. User's don't have to supply the `prometheusUrl` as we
  can access the same from `linkerd-config-addons` Configmap.
- More checks can be added here, if there are some known configurations that
  don't go well with linkerd.

##### linkerd prom-config

A additional command can be provided in the CLI, which outputs the
prometheus-config corresponding to that version of linkerd, which would have the
relevant scrape-configs and default configuration.

### Prior art

[prior-art]: #prior-art

- [Prometheus  Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator) is a
  interesting tool, which can remove the problem of maintaining configuration
  for upgrades, etc from Linkerd, but comes with it's own controller and CRD's.
- Specific to resource costs, We can consider things like tuning prometheus,
  dropping labels, etc making it further lighter but there will still be some
  users who would want to use their exisitng prometheus. Irrespective of this
  solution, we should definitely try to be light on linkerd-prometheus and also
  provide as many knobs for configuration making it easy to manage. This could
  be addressed separately and [rfc/21](https://github.com/linkerd/rfc/pull/21)
  has some similarities.
- Istio's [Bring your own Prometheus
  example](https://istiobyexample.dev/prometheus/). A similar helm based
  sub-chart model is used but this was with Mixer v1.
- We already have docs for [exporting
  metrics](https://linkerd.io/2/tasks/exporting-metrics/). We could update those
  docs, with remote-write, etc.

### Unresolved questions

[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- Should we support all prometheus configs in `linkerd-prometheus`?

- How do we keep track of metrics that the proxies expose, to have consistent
  check tooling?

- Most third party storage solutions have some auth mechanisms, should we allow
  that? IMO, we shouldn't focus on this in v1 but as folks start to call out we
  can consider updating to handle that use case.

- Should we separate out each induvidual fields of `proemtheus` i.e
  `remoteWrite`, etc into separate configmaps?

### Future possibilities

[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

In this proposal, we separate the query path with the linkerd-promethues, Thus
allowing users to use any third party long term storage solution that follow the
prometheus Query API to power Dashboards and CLI.

Also, The same `bring your own prometheus` document can be re-used for solutions
like [grafana cloud
agent](https://grafana.com/blog/2020/03/18/introducing-grafana-cloud-agent-a-remote_write-focused-prometheus-agent-that-can-save-40-on-memory-usage/)
that follow the same prometheus scrape-config.
