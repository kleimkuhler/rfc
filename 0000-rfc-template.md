## Summary

[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the proposed contribution.

## Problem Statement (Step 1)

[problem-statement]: #problem-statement

- What problem are you trying to solve?
- What is the context or background in which this problem exists?
- Once the proposal is implemented, how will the system change?

Please avoid discussing your proposed solution.

## Design proposal (Step 2)

[design-proposal]: #design-proposal

**Note**: This should be completed as part of `Step 2`.

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient
detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear
- It is reasonably clear how the contribution would be implemented
- Corner cases are dissected by example
- Dependencies on libraries, tools, projects or work that isn't yet complete
- Use Cases
- Goals
- Non-Goals
- Deliverables

### Prior art

[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A
few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this functionality exist in other software and what experience has their
  community had?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have
  done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If
  you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed
  theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the
lessons from other software, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us
whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other software.

### Unresolved questions

[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process
  before this gets merged?

### Future possibilities

[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC
you are writing but otherwise related.
